I created the n-body simulation by implementing physics and animation into the program. We used newtons laws of gravity to determine position and velocity of the planets over a set period of time while stepping forward inset intervals. The project contains the nessisary fonts, images, and audio files to build the program. It also contains the makefile and 2 objects needed to make the simulation. Lastly there is the main file that contains all the code to initilize and setup the simulation. To run compile with the makefile and then pass in the total time T and the time you want to step forward in the simulation deltaT and then pass in the planets.txt file with the < command.
